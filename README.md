# KV-Store

## Usage
On Linux you can run the project by:
```console
MY_IP=<your_ip> python server.py
```
or you can simply set the environment variable yourself.

When running, the components can be stopped gracefully by inputting ‘q’ or crashed via ‘c’.
We employ 4 levels of logging that can be toggled with ‘v’.

To run the client request inputting ‘s’ results in a store request and ‘r’ in a retrieve request.
